# Crosstool-NG Setup and Usage Guide

Crosstool-NG is a versatile and customizable tool for building cross-compilers. This guide walks you through the installation process and basic usage of Crosstool-NG.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the Crosstool-NG repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng
```
**What this does**: Downloads the Crosstool-NG source code to your local machine.

### 2. Checkout to Tag `1.26.0`
Switch to the specified version tag:
```bash
git checkout 1.26.0
```
**What this does**: Ensures you are working with the stable version `1.26.0` of Crosstool-NG.

### 3. Bootstrap the Build System
Prepare the build system:
```bash
./bootstrap
```
**What this does**: Initializes the build environment for Crosstool-NG.

### 4. Configure the Build
Run the configuration script with local installation enabled:
```bash
./configure --enable-local
```
**What this does**: Configures Crosstool-NG for a local build. Ensure any required dependencies are installed 
it will give you some errors to install the dependencies required
```bash
sudo apt install <dependency>
```
_Example_: `sudo apt install bison`

### 5. Build Crosstool-NG
Compile the Crosstool-NG source code:
```bash
make
```
**What this does**: Compiles the Crosstool-NG executable file. After this step, you will have the `ct-ng` executable ready to use.

For additional information, refer to the [Crosstool-NG Documentation](https://crosstool-ng.github.io/docs/).

## Using Crosstool-NG

### 1. List Available Samples
Display the list of pre-configured samples:
```bash
./ct-ng list-samples | grep <architecture>
```
**What this does**: Filters the available samples for the architecture of your choice.

### 2. Select a Sample
Choose a sample for your desired architecture:
```bash
./ct-ng <architecture>
```
**What this does**: Selects the toolchain configuration for the specified architecture.

### 3. Open the Menu Configuration
Customize your toolchain configuration:
```bash
./ct-ng menuconfig
```
**What this does**: Opens an interactive menu to edit the selected toolchain configuration.

### 4. Edit Your Toolchain
Make any necessary changes to the configuration.
**What this does**: Allows you to tailor the toolchain to your specific needs.

### 5. Build the Toolchain
Generate the toolchain:
```bash
./ct-ng build
```
**What this does**: Builds the cross-compilation toolchain based on your configuration.

## Example: Cross-Compiling a Simple C Program

I used `arm` as an architecture and wrote a simple C program that adds two numbers and says hello to the user. This program was compiled with `arm-gcc` as part of the cross-compilation process.

### After the Build
After building the toolchain, you will have a directory called `x-tools`. Update your `PATH` to include the toolchain binaries:
```bash
export PATH=/home/patrick/x-tools/arm-patrick-linux-musleabihf/bin:$PATH
```
**What this does**: Allows you to use `arm-gcc` from anywhere.

### Creating an Alias
You can create an alias for `arm-gcc` to simplify its usage. For example:
```bash
alias P2arm-gcc='arm-patrick-linux-musleabihf-gcc' # 🌟
```
Now you can compile your program using:
```bash
P2arm-gcc main.c
```
This will produce an output file named `a.out`.

### Running the Program
If you try to run the program directly on your x86 machine:
```bash
./a.out
```
**Problem**: The executable `a.out` is built for an ARM architecture and cannot run on an x86 machine.

### Running the Program with QEMU
To test the program without an ARM physical machine, use QEMU. First, install QEMU:
```bash
sudo apt install qemu qemu-user
```
Attempting to run the program directly with QEMU:
```bash
qemu-arm ./a.out
```
**Error**: `Could not open '/lib/ld-musl-armhf.so.1': No such file or directory`

### Solution: Specify the Sysroot
The linker searches in the root file system of the Linux, but the `sysroot` file system is the one which contain the required libraries for arm. 
Run the program using:
```bash
qemu-arm -L /home/patrick/x-tools/arm-patrick-linux-musleabihf/arm-patrick-linux-musleabihf/sysroot ./a.out
```
**What this does**: The `-L` option tells QEMU where to look for shared libraries during runtime.

### Another thing you can do 
Compile the program statically, When you compile a program statically, all the necessary libraries (like libc, libm, etc.) are included directly in the binary (executable file) itself during the compilation process. This means the program doesn't need to dynamically link to external libraries at runtime. As a result, you don't need to worry about specifying the sysroot 

```
P2arm-gcc main.c
```

Now you can seamlessly run ARM-compiled programs on your x86 machine with QEMU.
